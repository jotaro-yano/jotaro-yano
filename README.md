# 👋 Hi, I’m Jotaro Yano

I’m an independent researcher exploring **privacy-preserving** and **post-quantum secure distributed cryptographic systems**, bridging theory and practice (focus: **ZK, PQC**).  
I aim to design cryptographic systems that remain both **practical** and **secure** in the post-quantum era.


## 📚 Research areas
- **Theory**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Post-Quantum Cryptography, ORAM, FHE  
- **Systems**: Blockchain validator clients, Consensus (PoS/PoW), On-chain verification  


## ✍️ Recent work
- [Full L1 On-Chain ZK-STARK+PQC Verification on Solana: A Measurement Study](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1741)  
  *(IACR ePrint 2025/1741, DOI: 10.5281/ZENODO.17186799)*


## 🛠️ Tech stack
- **High-performance crypto**: Rust 🦀, C/C++  
- **Smart contracts / ZK DSLs**: Solidity, Noir  
- **Prototyping / tools**: TypeScript (Node.js), JavaScript  
- **Past experience**: PHP, Python, Java, Ruby  


## 👨‍💻 Background
After years as a freelance engineer with hands-on experience in distributed systems, I shifted my focus to independent research on **cryptography** and **blockchain**.
