# 👋 Hi, I’m Jotaro Yano
[![ORCID](https://img.shields.io/badge/ORCID-0009--0003--5327--9455-green?logo=orcid&logoColor=white)](https://orcid.org/0009-0003-5327-9455)

I’m an independent researcher exploring **privacy-preserving** and **post-quantum secure distributed cryptographic systems**, bridging theory and practice (focus: **ZK, PQC**).  
I aim to design cryptographic systems that remain both **practical** and **secure** in the post-quantum era.


## 📚 Research areas
- **Theory**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Post-Quantum Cryptography, ORAM, FHE  
- **Systems**: Blockchain validator clients, Consensus (PoS/PoW), On-chain verification  


## ✍️ Recent work

- *ZK Coprocessor Bridge* 🛡️ — **🚧 In Development** *(built for the Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon)*  
  *Privacy coprocessor for Solana: bridge Solana to Aztec private functions via Ethereum using Wormhole VAAs — with finality guarantees and replay‑safe L1→L2 queues.*

## 🛠️ Tech stack
- **High-performance crypto**: Rust 🦀, C/C++  
- **Smart contracts / ZK DSLs**: Solidity, Noir  
- **Prototyping / tools**: TypeScript (Node.js), JavaScript  
- **Past experience**: PHP, Python, Java, Ruby  


## 👨‍💻 Background
After years as a freelance engineer, I shifted my focus to independent research on **cryptography** and **blockchain**.

I also run **[PQZK Labs](https://github.com/pqzk-labs)** (@pqzk-labs), an organization dedicated to repositories on **Zero-Knowledge proofs** and **Post-Quantum Cryptography**.  
Other projects and explorations will be published here on my **personal repositories**.
